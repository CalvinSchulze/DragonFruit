# Preview builds and CI permissions

What you can trigger in this repository once you have write access, what each
thing costs, and the one case where you should stop and ask.

## Preview builds

A **preview build** compiles any branch on demand and publishes it as a rolling
`preview_{branch}` prerelease, so a reviewer can download and run an exact
commit. It is not a nightly, it is not on a schedule, and it is not wired to
the auto-updater — see [Releases and channels](releases.md) for how real
releases work.

### On a pull request from this repository

Comment `/preview` on the pull request:

```text
/preview
/preview Feature: organic cut          ← optional custom release name
```

The build starts immediately, and the `preview-build` label goes on the pull
request. From then on **every push rebuilds it** once the macOS check passes.
Remove the label to stop.

### On a pull request from a fork

`/preview` will not build it. You get a comment pointing you here instead.

The reason is worth understanding rather than working around: a preview build
runs the branch's own code — `npm ci` lifecycle scripts, `build.rs` scripts,
the whole toolchain — in a job that holds the Apple Developer ID certificate,
the app-specific password and the updater signing key. Building a branch is
running its code with those secrets in reach.

Once you have **read the diff**, run:

```text
/create-preview-external
```

That resolves the pull request's current head SHA, points `preview/pr-<number>`
at that exact commit, and builds that branch. It imports **one commit**. Later
pushes do not rebuild — you run the command again, which means you look again.
The acknowledgement comment records the SHA that was imported, so anyone can
check afterwards what was actually built.

Preview branches are deleted automatically once their pull request closes.

!!! warning "If you are not sure, ask"

    If you feel pressured to create a preview, and/or you are not sure if an
    external PR's code is safe, please ask a senior member of the dev team
    before risking our keys.

    Nobody will mind the delay. A contributor waiting an extra day for a test
    build costs us nothing; a signing certificate used to sign someone else's
    malware costs us the certificate, every release ever signed with it, and
    the trust of everyone running DragonFruit on macOS.

### What to look for in an external diff

You are not being asked to audit the whole change for correctness — the code
review does that. You are asking one narrower question: **does this branch try
to run something at build time?** In particular:

- new or changed `scripts` in `package.json` (`preinstall`, `postinstall`,
  `prepare`) — these run during `npm ci`
- new or changed `build.rs`, or `[build-dependencies]` in a `Cargo.toml`
- new dependencies pulled from somewhere other than the usual registries, or a
  submodule pointed at an unfamiliar repository
- changes to anything under `.github/`, or to `scripts/`

None of these are automatically suspicious — plugins legitimately add build
scripts. They are the places to slow down and read properly.

## Other things write access lets you trigger

| What | How | What it does |
|------|-----|--------------|
| Preview build | `/preview` comment | Builds the branch, publishes a `preview_{branch}` prerelease |
| External preview | `/create-preview-external` comment | Imports one commit to `preview/pr-N` and builds it |
| Rebuild on every push | `preview-build` label | Same as `/preview`, standing until the label is removed |
| Manual workflow run | Actions tab → *Run workflow* | `build-preview`, `release`, `docs-pages`, `plugin-registry-guardrails`, `warm-rust-cache` |

`/preview` and `/create-preview-external` check your permission when you run
them: repository `write`, `maintain` or `admin`, or membership of the
`@Open-Resin-Alliance/administrators` team. Anyone else gets a polite refusal
comment. Applying the `preview-build` label needs `triage` or above, which is
GitHub's own gate rather than ours.

**`release.yml` is not a preview.** It publishes a real release, and it fires
on a push to `main` or `dev` that touches `package.json`, `src-tauri/`,
`scripts/`, `flatpak/` or the workflow itself — not only when someone dispatches
it by hand. Keep that in mind when merging.

## Why external pull requests get no secrets at all

GitHub does not give repository secrets to a workflow triggered by a
`pull_request` event from a fork. That is deliberate on GitHub's part and we
rely on it: the macOS check that runs on every pull request builds fork code
with no certificate and no keys, falls back to ad-hoc signing, and proves the
app compiles. Nothing more.

That is also why a fork's check build produces a bundle macOS will refuse to
open without going through **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Open
Anyway**. It is unsigned on purpose. If a contributor needs something a tester
can actually run, that is what `/create-preview-external` is for — after
someone has read the code.
